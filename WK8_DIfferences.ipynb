An [article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/where-did-trump-make-election-gains-unemployment-data-tells-surprising-n1247935) in NBC claims that \"analysis of unemployment and voting data found that the president’s share of the vote held steady or increased in each of the 20 counties with the highest rise in unemployment from September 2019 to September 2020.

This is particularly important if we're interested in investigating the relationship between unemployment and voting behaviour, because of the urban-rural divide. For example, with in the state of New York there are probably vast differences in social and economic factors relevant to voting behaviour between Manhattan and very rural areas; this variation is lost when we look at aggregate state-level resutls, but visible when we look at the county-level. As such, in addition to the datasets we've just imported, we're going to be downloading county-level unemployment data straight from the BLS using the loop below."

Of course, random assignment is usually not possible with most survey research. If we want to control for the effect of a variable, we must explicitly measure it. If we don’t measure it, we can’t control for it.

We can think of $\\alpha_i$ as representing the effects of all the time invariant/stable variables that have NOT been included in the model. So, given that we have 6 time periods for each county then the six records for county 1 would all have the same value for $\\alpha_1$, the six records for county 2 would all have the same value for $\\alpha_2$, etc. But, $\\epsilon_{it}$ is free to be different for every case at every time period.\n",

All that is left is the within-subject variability. So, with a fixed effects model, we are analyzing what causes individual’s values to change across time. Variables whose values do not change (like race or gender) cannot cause changes across time (unless their effects change across time as well). However, whatever effect they have at one time is the same effect that they have at other times, so the effects of such stable characteristics are controlled.\n",

This is important, as we want to find one slope-- one common effect of x-- that fits *all* groups."

        "One of the reasons that we observe a signficant relationship between unemployment and voting behaviour in last week's workshop is that the Republican and Democratic parties have opposing views on what to do about unemployment. Democratic lawmakers have historically been in favour of increasing the minimum wage to benefit low-income workers, while Republicans have generally opposed this on the basis that it would hurt these very workers by increase unemployment. Indeed, classical economic theory holds that an increase in wages would lead to a reduction in employment; A business that makes $100k in revenue per year and spends all of it on employing 20 people can't suddenly start paying their workers double their salaries-- unless it fires half of its workers. This is obviously a simplified model though-- minimum wage laws typically don't double wages, and businesses don't operate at-cost, they turn a profit which they could use to pay their workers more. In the rest of this workshop, we're going to be investigating this question empirically:\n",

The burden of proof here is much higher than observing correlations, and we have to think seriously about **endogeneity**. In partiuclar, we need to account for the influence of omitted variables (e.g. a recession, or the economic composition of a state), the potential for reverse causality (states implementing minimum wage laws in response to unemployment crises), and selection bias.\n",

        "In a lab, you can conduct causal inference by running an experiment. You can randomly select individuals, split them into a control group and a treatment group, measure their values in an outcome variable prior to a treatment, administer a treatment, and measure their respective values after the treatment. If you observe a change in the outcome variable in the treatment group after having administered the treatment, you can interpert that as the causal effect of treatment. This is because we're able to make a plausible argument that the **control group can act as a counterfactual (a stand-in) for the treatment group in the absence of treatment**. Both groups had the same values before the treatment, then the only thing that changed between them was the treatment, so if we observe a change in the outcome variable, it must be due to treatment.\n",

The plateaus exist because each row in the dataframe `df_s` is the value of a state in a given *month*, but we only have minimum wage data for every *year*. So we get 12 consecutive values of minimum wage every year. The reason that the staircases are descending is because these minimum wages are adjusted for inflation. No matter where you're from, you've probably heard a grandparent say something along the lines of \"My parents would send me to the shops with 25 cents to buy groceries for the week\", but now it costs £9 for a bag of chips. That's inflation-- every year things tend to get slightly more expensive, so if the same *absolute* minimum wage actually diminishes in \"real\" terms, which is what the variable `minwage` measures.

In 2020, New Jersey's minimum wage was around 50% higher than Pennsylvania's.
